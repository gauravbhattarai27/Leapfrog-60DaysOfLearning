#  Day 8 – Attention Is All You Need


---



Today, I explored the foundational research paper that revolutionized modern NLP:

> **“Attention Is All You Need” – Vaswani et al., 2017**  
>  [Read the paper (NeurIPS 2017)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf)

---

##  Key Learnings

- The **Transformer model** introduced a new way to handle sequence data **without recurrence (RNNs/LSTMs)**.
- Learned how **Self-Attention** enables each word to focus on all other words in a sentence.
- Understood the role of **Queries, Keys, and Values** in computing attention scores.
- Explored **Multi-Head Attention** for capturing multiple types of relationships in parallel.
- Understood the need for **Positional Encoding** to retain word order.
- Studied the **Encoder-Decoder** architecture used for tasks like translation.
- Gained insights into how this architecture enables faster, parallelized training compared to RNNs.

---

##  Tools & Techniques Explored

- Paper reading and breakdown
- Hand-drawn architecture sketching
- Visualized attention mechanisms using simplified examples
- Related the architecture to modern models like **GPT, BERT, and T5**
